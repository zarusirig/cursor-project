# Corrections Policy

## Commitment to Accuracy
CNP News strives for perfection but acknowledges that mistakes can occur. Our corrections policy safeguards trust by rectifying errors transparently and promptly. Trustworthiness is the cornerstone of our editorial mission【490377143752729†L10-L16】.

## What Constitutes a Correction
- **Factual errors:** Misstatements of fact, inaccurate figures, or incorrect attributions.
- **Contextual errors:** Missing critical context or misrepresenting the significance of information.
- **Technical updates:** Broken links or outdated information that materially affects understanding.

## Correction Workflow
1. **Identification:** Errors may be identified by staff, sources, or readers. Reports should be sent to the Executive Editor.
2. **Verification:** The Executive Editor investigates the claim. If an error is confirmed, a correction is initiated.
3. **Revision:** The article is updated with accurate information. We update the `dateModified` metadata only for meaningful changes【490377143752729†L137-L141】 and leave a visible correction note.
4. **Disclosure:** A correction note is added to the article, typically at the top or bottom, explaining what was changed and when. Minor typographical changes that do not affect meaning may be made silently.
5. **Notification:** If the article was widely shared or syndicated, we notify partners of the correction.

## Maintaining Transparency
- Correction notes remain permanently attached to the article.
- We do not remove original erroneous text unless it is defamatory or legally required. Instead, we strike it through and present the corrected content alongside.
- The correction note includes the date and, if necessary, a brief explanation of the error’s impact.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Executive Editor:** Oversees the corrections process, verifies errors, and approves all correction notes.
- **Authors:** Cooperate with investigations and supply supporting evidence for corrections.
- **Technical SEO Specialist:** Ensures updated articles are re‑indexed by submitting refreshed sitemaps when necessary.
