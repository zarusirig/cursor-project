# AI Disclosure

## Why We Use AI
CNP News leverages artificial intelligence to streamline our newsroom operations, including story discovery, summarisation, and data extraction. AI allows us to process large volumes of information quickly so that our editors can focus on analysis and value‑add commentary.

## Human Oversight
- **Editorial control:** AI‑generated drafts are always reviewed by a human editor for accuracy, context, tone, and completeness.
- **Value‑add:** Our human editors enrich AI summaries with analysis, expert quotes, and original reporting to meet our value‑add requirement【490377143752729†L62-L74】.
- **Corrections:** Editors update or rewrite AI‑produced content as needed to correct errors or fill gaps.

## Transparency to Readers
- Articles that have received AI assistance are labelled with an “AI‑assisted” disclosure at the beginning or end of the piece.
- We clearly identify any generative tools used (e.g., summarisation algorithms) and explain how they contributed to the content.

## Limitations of AI
AI cannot replace human judgement or original reporting. We do not use AI to create large volumes of thin or unverified content; doing so would constitute scaled content abuse【490377143752729†L62-L74】. Our editors are responsible for ensuring that every published article meets our editorial and ethical standards.

## Data Usage
AI services may process publicly available information. We do not feed personal data or confidential information into AI models.
