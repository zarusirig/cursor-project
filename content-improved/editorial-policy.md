## Our Commitment to Accuracy

Every article at CNP News undergoes fact-checking before publication. We:

1. **Verify all factual claims** with at least two independent sources
2. **Link to primary sources** (official announcements, research papers, regulatory filings, government data)
3. **Distinguish clearly** between reported facts and analysis/opinion
4. **Correct errors within 24 hours** of discovery (see [Corrections Policy](#corrections-policy))
5. **Update evergreen content** quarterly or when significant developments occur

### Fact-Checking Process

**For News Articles:**
1. Reporter gathers information from primary sources
2. All factual claims cross-referenced with official documents
3. Quotes verified via email or recording transcripts
4. Senior editor reviews before publication
5. Changes logged in editorial system

**For Reviews & Comparisons:**
1. Products tested in production-like environments
2. Testing methodology documented
3. Performance data verified across multiple test runs
4. Vendor documentation cross-referenced
5. Pricing verified against official sources at time of publication

## Editorial Independence

CNP News maintains strict editorial independence from all commercial interests.

### What We Don't Do

❌ **No pay-for-play:** We do not accept payment for coverage. Editorial decisions are made solely by our editors based on newsworthiness and reader value.

❌ **No vendor influence:** Advertisers and sponsors have no input into editorial decisions, article framing, or publication timing.

❌ **No undisclosed conflicts:** Staff cannot own securities in companies they cover. Any unavoidable conflicts are disclosed in articles.

❌ **No ghostwriting:** All content is written or substantially edited by our named editorial staff. AI assistance is disclosed.

### What We Do

✅ **Independent testing:** We purchase products for testing or use time-limited trials. Products are not kept.

✅ **Honest verdicts:** Our reviews reflect our genuine assessment, regardless of affiliate relationships.

✅ **Transparent funding:** We disclose our revenue sources (display ads, affiliate commissions, sponsored content) and maintain a firewall between business and editorial.

✅ **Reader advocacy:** Our primary obligation is to our readers, not to vendors or advertisers.

## Sources & Verification

CNP News prioritizes authoritative sources and primary documents.

### Source Hierarchy (in priority order)

1. **Primary sources:**
   - Official company announcements and documentation
   - Regulatory filings (SEC, Federal Register, EUR-Lex)
   - Peer-reviewed research papers
   - Government statistics and reports
   - Direct interviews with company spokespeople

2. **Secondary sources:**
   - Established news organizations (Bloomberg, WSJ, Reuters)
   - Industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester, IDC)
   - Academic institutions
   - Think tanks with transparent funding

3. **Tertiary sources (used sparingly):**
   - Blog posts (only from recognized experts)
   - Social media (only for breaking news, always verified)
   - Anonymous sources (only when unavoidable, with editor approval)

### Anonymous Sources

We use anonymous sources only when:
- Information is newsworthy and unavailable on the record
- Source has direct knowledge
- Senior editor approves
- We can corroborate information through documents or additional sources

We do not grant anonymity for:
- Attacks on individuals or organizations
- Speculation or rumor
- Information available from named sources

### Verification Standards

**For Technical Claims:**
- Verified against official documentation
- Tested in production-like environments when possible
- Cross-referenced with multiple sources

**For Performance Claims:**

## AI Disclosure & Human Oversight

CNP News uses AI language models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4) to assist with research and drafting. AI is a tool, not a replacement for human editorial judgment.

### How We Use AI

✅ **Research assistance:** Summarizing technical documentation, identifying relevant sources
✅ **Outline generation:** Structuring long-form explainers and comparisons
✅ **Draft generation:** Creating initial drafts based on human-provided briefs
✅ **Copy editing:** Grammar and style suggestions

### What AI Does NOT Do

❌ **Fact verification:** All facts verified by human editors against primary sources
❌ **Editorial decisions:** Framing, angle, publication decisions are human-only
❌ **Opinion/analysis:** Expert analysis comes from human editors, not AI
❌ **Source selection:** Editors choose sources based on authority and relevance

### Human Oversight Requirements

Every AI-assisted article must:

1. **Human fact-check:** Editor verifies every factual claim against primary sources
2. **Substantial rewrite:** Editor rewrites AI drafts to add expertise, nuance, and experience-based insights
3. **Senior review:** Senior editors approve all content before publication
4. **Disclosure:** AI assistance disclosed at top of article with link to this policy

### AI Limitations We Acknowledge

We are aware of AI limitations and mitigate them through human oversight:

- **Hallucinations:** AI can fabricate facts. We verify everything.
- **Bias:** AI training data contains biases. We apply editorial judgment and seek diverse sources.
- **Staleness:** AI knowledge has cutoff dates. We cite current sources and update content regularly.
- **Lack of expertise:** AI lacks domain expertise. Our human editors add technical depth.
