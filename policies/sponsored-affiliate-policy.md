# Sponsored & Affiliate Content Policy

## Purpose
This policy governs how CNP News handles sponsored articles, native advertising, and affiliate links. Our goal is to protect readers from deceptive practices, maintain editorial independence, and avoid Site Reputation Abuse (SRA)【490377143752729†L40-L56】.

## Editorial Independence
- Editorial decisions are never influenced by advertisers, sponsors, or affiliate partners. We do not accept compensation to alter our opinions.
- Sponsored content is produced by our editorial team or clearly labelled contributors and must adhere to the same standards of accuracy and value‑add as all editorial pieces【490377143752729†L40-L56】.

## Disclosure Requirements
- **Sponsored articles:** Labelled with “Sponsored” at the top of the page and include a brief statement explaining the nature of the sponsorship.
- **Affiliate links:** All affiliate links include the `rel="sponsored"` attribute and appear only within high‑quality reviews, how‑to guides, or case studies【490377143752729†L40-L56】. We disclose that we may earn a commission if readers make a purchase.
- **Non‑editorial paid content:** Must be isolated from our main editorial domain or marked noindex/nofollow to prevent SRA【490377143752729†L54-L57】.

## Acceptable Sponsored Content
We accept sponsorships or partnerships for:
- Hands‑on product reviews or case studies that genuinely help readers evaluate tools.
- Thought leadership articles authored by verified experts, provided they deliver new insights and meet our editorial standards.

## Unacceptable Sponsored Content
- Low‑value, thin content whose sole purpose is to rank by exploiting our domain authority【490377143752729†L54-L57】.
- Content that promotes products or services without demonstrating genuine experience or providing a clear value‑add【490377143752729†L62-L74】.

## Vetting Process
1. **Proposal review:** The Director of Digital Strategy & Authority evaluates each sponsorship opportunity for alignment with our brand and audience.
2. **Editorial review:** The Executive Editor ensures that sponsored content meets our standards and adds unique value.
3. **Technical review:** The Technical SEO Specialist verifies proper use of `rel="sponsored"` and ensures the content does not risk SRA or scaled content abuse.
