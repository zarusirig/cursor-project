# Headline CTR Optimization Playbook

High click‑through rates (CTR) translate visibility into traffic. This playbook outlines a systematic approach to testing and improving headlines and meta descriptions.

## 1. Identify Opportunities
- Use Google Search Console’s Performance report to find pages with high impressions but low CTR【490377143752729†L457-L462】.
- Prioritise evergreen articles and high‑value hub pages for optimisation.

## 2. Formulate Hypotheses
- Draft multiple headline and meta description variants based on user intent, search trends, and seasonality【490377143752729†L465-L467】.
- Hypotheses should be grounded in data—for example: “A headline that includes the reader’s primary goal (e.g., ‘Reduce Costs’) will attract more clicks.”

## 3. Testing Framework
1. Create 2–3 headline variants and corresponding meta descriptions.
2. Implement A/B testing using a headline testing plugin or n8n workflow that assigns different titles to users randomly.
3. Run the test for a statistically significant period (e.g., one to two weeks) and collect CTR data.
4. Analyse results in GSC or GA4. Choose the winning variant and update the article permanently.

## 4. Optimisation Guidelines
- **Match Search Intent:** Headlines should align with what users are searching for; avoid clickbait.
- **Incorporate Numbers & Brackets:** Lists and brackets often increase CTR (e.g., “5 Ways to…”). Use sparingly.
- **Use Power Words Carefully:** Terms like “Ultimate”, “Definitive”, or “Essential” can boost clicks, but overuse dilutes trust.
- **Keep Length in Check:** Aim for 50–60 characters to avoid truncation.
- **Localisation:** Use region‑specific terms when targeting geographic segments (e.g., “India’s AI Policy…”).

## 5. Avoiding Cannibalisation
- Check for multiple pages targeting the same keyword. If two pages compete, consolidate or differentiate them【490377143752729†L470-L472】.

## 6. Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular reviews (e.g., monthly) to re‑evaluate high‑traffic pages.
- Document all tests and outcomes in a spreadsheet for future reference.
