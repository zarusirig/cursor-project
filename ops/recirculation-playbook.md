# Recirculation Playbook

Recirculation keeps readers engaged and increases page views per session. This playbook describes how to encourage users to explore more articles within our ecosystem.

## Principles
- **Contextual Relevance:** Recommend articles that relate to the current topic or entity. Use tags and categories to generate logical suggestions.
- **Three‑Way Link Flow:** Ensure every Cluster Page links back to its Pillar Hub and to related Cluster Pages【490377143752729†L383-L391】.
- **Non‑Intrusive Placement:** Place recirculation blocks where they aid the reader, such as after major sections or at the end of the article—not above the fold.

## Implementation
1. **Mid‑Article Callouts:** Use block patterns to insert “Further Reading” callouts that link back to the Pillar Hub and highlight 2–3 related Cluster Pages.
2. **Related Articles Widget:** At the end of every article, display a widget listing 3–5 related articles from the same hub. Use metadata (tags, categories) to generate these links.
3. **In‑Hub Navigation:** On Pillar Hubs, provide filters or tabs to navigate subtopics. Include a dynamic list of recently published Cluster Pages.
4. **Sidebar or Inline Cards:** For long articles, insert inline cards linking to evergreen explainers or product reviews.
5. **Tag Pages:** Build curated tag pages (entity hubs) that highlight all articles about a specific person or company. Avoid auto‑generated tag pages【490377143752729†L205-L213】.

## Measurement & Optimization
- Track `recirculation_click` events in GA4 to measure engagement.
- Analyse which recommendations have higher click rates and adjust algorithms accordingly.
- A/B test the design and placement of recirculation blocks.
