# Information Architecture Blueprint

This blueprint defines the structural backbone for cnpnews.net/en. It translates our brand positioning into a navigable, search‑friendly hierarchy that maximises topical authority and user experience.

## Pillar Hubs (Topical Authority Clusters)
We organise our deepest content into four Pillar Hubs. Each Hub is a long‑form “pillar” page that defines a systemic topic and links to dozens of supporting “spoke” articles. This structure signals comprehensive expertise to search engines【490377143752729†L351-L359】.

| Pillar Hub | Primary Focus | E‑E‑A‑T & Audience Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Enterprise AI & Automation 🤖** | Moving AI from research into practical, value‑driving business application. | Builds Experience and Expertise by focusing on deployment and ROI. Serves Business Owners and Practitioners. |
| **Geopolitics of Tech & Commerce 🌐** | Macro‑level policy and regulatory forces shaping global tech and investment decisions. | Non‑partisan Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness. Serves C‑Suite and policy professionals. |
| **Financial Tech & Investment 💰** | The flow of capital, M&A activity, and innovation within financial services and the startup ecosystem. | High‑stakes Trustworthiness (YMYL‑adjacent). Serves Entrepreneurs and investment‑focused practitioners. |
| **Foundational Tech & Infrastructure 🛠️** | Underlying hardware, cloud, and security powering the modern economy (chips, 5G, cybersecurity). | Builds Expertise in the “picks and shovels.” Serves technical practitioners, learners, and AI enthusiasts. |

Each Pillar Hub links to its supporting Cluster Pages. Cluster Pages dive into specific subtopics or entities and link back to their Hub. Related Cluster Pages interlink to reinforce semantic relationships【490377143752729†L383-L391】.

## Top‑Level Categories
Categories provide high‑level navigation and house content from multiple Pillar Hubs. They appear in the main menu and define RSS feeds. Our categories are broad enough to capture diverse audiences while supporting deep linking and topical breadth【490377143752729†L205-L213】.

1. **Strategy & Analysis:** Executive summaries, risk analysis, and forward‑looking trends for business owners and entrepreneurs.
2. **Artificial Intelligence:** News and deep dives on LLMs, generative AI, machine learning, and ethics for all audiences.
3. **Startups & Capital:** Funding rounds, venture capital, IPOs, M&A, and early‑stage company profiles for entrepreneurs.
4. **Policy & Regulation:** Antitrust cases, data privacy, trade, and government tech policy for practitioners and policy experts.
5. **Fintech & Markets:** Banking innovation, crypto, DeFi, and tech‑driven market movements for finance professionals.
6. **Reviews & Tools (Affiliate Focus):** Hands‑on reviews, comparisons, and best‑of lists for AI/SaaS tools. This is our monetisation hub.
7. **Cybersecurity:** Enterprise security, data breaches, privacy, and infrastructure protection for practitioners.
8. **Career & Learning:** Skills development, job trends, technical education, and workforce automation for learners and students.

## Taxonomy and Tagging
Categories form the primary hierarchy. Tags should be used deliberately to group articles around specific entities—people, companies, technologies, or places【490377143752729†L205-L213】. Tags must come from an approved allowlist maintained in a shared spreadsheet. This reduces tag bloat and ensures consistent entity mapping.

## Internal Linking Protocol
To maximise topical authority and distribute link equity, we follow a three‑way internal linking protocol【490377143752729†L383-L391】:

1. **Cluster → Pillar:** Every Cluster Page links back to its Pillar Hub using descriptive anchor text that reinforces the Hub’s topic.
2. **Pillar → Cluster:** The Pillar Hub links out to all of its Cluster Pages, using keyword‑rich anchor text that reflects each subtopic.
3. **Cluster → Cluster:** Related Cluster Pages interlink to encourage user exploration and share authority laterally.

High‑authority evergreen articles should also link to new or lower‑performing content to accelerate indexing and ranking【490377143752729†L395-L397】.

## Suppression of Thin Archives
Low‑value tag archives and uncurated taxonomies must be set to `noindex` to avoid diluting crawl budget and authority【490377143752729†L205-L213】.
