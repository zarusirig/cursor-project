# Editorial Policy

## Purpose and Scope
Our editorial policy ensures CNP News maintains the highest levels of trustworthiness, accuracy, and transparency【490377143752729†L10-L17】. We are committed to publishing original and curated content that demystifies technology and business while upholding ethical standards across our newsroom.

## Key Principles
- **E‑E‑A‑T alignment:** Every piece of content must demonstrate experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Trust is paramount: content cannot be valuable if perceived as untrustworthy【490377143752729†L10-L16】.
- **Value‑add requirement:** Aggregated or syndicated stories must include unique context, research, commentary, or verification to avoid scaled content abuse【490377143752729†L62-L74】.
- **Source transparency:** All factual claims must be supported by credible sources; citations and external links should be provided when necessary.
- **Corrections and accountability:** We publicly correct errors and document changes. See our corrections policy for details.
- **Independence:** Editorial decisions are independent of advertising or affiliate relationships; commercial partnerships never dictate coverage.

## Byline and Authorship
- Authors must be qualified practitioners or subject‑matter experts. Author bios include credentials and links to authoritative profiles.
- “Staff Desk” bylines are used only for aggregated news summarised by our team. Editors are acknowledged within the article and a value‑add section explains the context.

## Editorial Workflow
1. **Research and planning:** Topics are selected based on audience needs and our topical authority blueprint.
2. **Drafting:** Writers or automation flows produce drafts following our page templates. Each draft must add unique value.
3. **Review:** Editors fact‑check, verify sources, and ensure compliance with our ethical, E‑E‑A‑T, and trust standards.
4. **Publication:** Approved content is published with the correct taxonomy, internal links, structured data, and disclosures.
5. **Monitoring:** Performance metrics (CTR, engagement) inform re‑optimization decisions without compromising integrity.

## Sponsored and Affiliate Content
All sponsored or affiliate content is clearly labelled and separated from editorial matter. Affiliate links use the `rel="sponsored"` attribute and appear only within high‑E‑E‑A‑T content【490377143752729†L40-L56】. We never accept compensation to alter our opinions or recommendations.
