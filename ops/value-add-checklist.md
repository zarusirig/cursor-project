# Value‑Add Checklist

To prevent scaled content abuse and ensure every piece of content delivers real value, use this checklist when creating aggregated or curated stories【490377143752729†L62-L74】.

## Context & Insight
1. **Add Background:** Provide a timeline or background section explaining the significance of the news.
2. **Expert Commentary:** Include quotes from subject‑matter experts or your own analysis explaining the implications for readers.
3. **Comparison & Contrast:** Relate the news to similar events or trends and explain how it fits into a bigger picture.
4. **Local/Industry Angle:** Highlight how the story affects specific industries, regions, or reader segments.

## Verification
1. **Source Triangulation:** Reference multiple credible sources to confirm facts. If you rely on a press release or single feed, verify the information independently.
2. **Data & Evidence:** Where possible, include data charts, statistics, or original reporting.

## Enhancement
1. **Visual Aids:** Use images, charts, or diagrams to illustrate key points.
2. **Resource Links:** Provide links to in‑depth related articles or official documents for further reading.
3. **Actionable Takeaways:** Summarise what readers should do or understand next (e.g., “Key steps for entrepreneurs”).

## Editorial Notes
1. **Attribution:** If repurposing content from feeds, attribute the original source clearly and ethically.
2. **Avoid Thin Copy:** Do not publish content that merely rewrites the headline. If there’s no value to add, consider not publishing.
