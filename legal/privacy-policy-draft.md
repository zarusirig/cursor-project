## Introduction
Welcome to CNP News. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share data when you interact with our website. It is governed by United States law and applies to visitors worldwide.

## Information We Collect
We collect two types of information:

1. **Personal information** you voluntarily provide when you comment, subscribe to newsletters, or contact us (e.g., your name and email address).
2. **Usage data** such as IP address, browser type, device information, and pages visited. This data is collected via cookies, analytics tools, and server logs.

## How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:

- Provide and improve our content, services, and user experience.
- Send newsletters and updates when you subscribe.
- Analyse traffic patterns and performance using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and other analytics platforms.
- Comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies
We use cookies to remember your preferences, perform analytics, and support advertising campaigns. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some third‑party services (e.g., embedded videos, social buttons) may place their own cookies; consult their policies for details.

## Sharing Your Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:

- **Service providers** that help us operate the site (e.g., hosting, analytics, email delivery). These providers must protect your data and use it only for our purposes.
- **Legal authorities** if required by law or to protect our rights and the rights of others.

## Data Security
